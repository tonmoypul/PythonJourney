#Local scope means that a variable declared inside a function or class can only be accessed within that function or class.

#Here's an example:

def my_func():
    my_var = 10
    print(my_var)
#In this case, the my_func function has its own scope which cannot be accessed from outside the function. Calling my_func will output 10, but printing my_var outside the function will lead to a NameError:

def my_func():
    my_var = 10 # Locally scoped to my_func
    print(my_var)

my_func() # 10

#print(my_var) # NameError: name 'my_var' is not defined


#Enclosing scope means that a function that's nested inside another function can access the variables of the function it's nested within.

#For example:

def outer_func():
    msg = 'Hello there!'

    def inner_func():
        print(msg)

    inner_func()

outer_func() # Hello there!
#In this example, the inner function, inner_func, can freely access the msg variable defined in the outer function, outer_func. However, note that outer functions cannot access variables defined within any nested functions:

def outer_func():
    msg = 'Hello there!'
    print(res)

    def inner_func():
        res = 'How are you?'
        print(msg)

    inner_func()

#outer_func() # NameError: name 'res' is not defined
#That's because res is locally scoped to inner_func. Also, notice that outer_func tries to print res before inner_func is called.

#One solution is to initialize res as an empty string in the enclosing scope, which is within outer_func. Then within inner_func, make res a non-local variable with the nonlocal keyword:

def outer_func():
    msg = 'Hello there!'
    res = ""  # Declare res in the enclosing scope

    def inner_func():
        nonlocal res  # Allow modification of an enclosing variable
        res = 'How are you?'
        print(msg)  # Accessing msg from outer_func()

    inner_func()
    print(res)  # Now res is accessible and modified

outer_func()

# Output:
# Hello there!
# How are you?

#Global scope refers to variables that are declared outside any functions or classes which can be accessed from anywhere in the program. Here, my_var can be accessed anywhere, even inside a function it's not defined in:

my_var = 100

def show_var():
    print(my_var)

show_var() # 100
print(my_var) # 100
#And if you want to make a locally scoped variable defined inside a function globally accessible, you can use the global keyword:

my_var_1 = 7

def show_vars():
    global my_var_2
    my_var_2 = 10
    print(my_var_1)
    print(my_var_2)

show_vars() # 7 10

# my_var_2 is now a global variable and can be accessed anywhere in the program
print(my_var_2) # 10
#You can also use the global keyword to modify a global variable:

my_var = 10  # A global variable

def change_var():
    global my_var  # Allows modification of a global variable
    my_var = 20

change_var()

print(my_var)  # my_var is now modified globally to 20
